<dt>- They became million sellers after their "NOEASY" comeback in August 2021 and were the first in their company (<i>JYP Entertainment</i>)
to do so (sold over 1 million copies - had 930,000 pre-orders and sold 641,589 in its first week)</dt>
<br>
<dt>- After performing a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDTG6o1vC2I" target="_blank"><i>Deadpool</i> inspired stage</a>  on MNET's "Kingdom: Legendary War" TV series,
Ryan Reynolds (who plays Deadpool) personally reached out to them and even sent Bang Chan his autograph along with a few items</dt>
<br>
<dt>- Fans of the group are called "STAY" which was derived from the word "Stray" in their name - the "r" stands for "reason" and
represents the fans being their reason and where they stay</dt>
<br>
<dt>- They are a self-producing group (this is usually unheard of in K-pop as many groups usually have most of their songs
made for them, but this is starting to change and become more popular)</dt>
<br>
<dt>- Their name is often abbreviated to <i>SKZ</i> by their fans</dt>
<br>
<dt>- <i>3RACHA</i> (mentioned on the home page - their producing team made of 3 of the members), originally started on the music platform
<a href="https://soundcloud.com/3RACHA" target="_blank"><i>SoundCloud</i></a> before Stray Kids were formed</dt>
<br>
<dt>- Most (if not all) of the members can speak and understand English quite well, with 2 of them (Bang Chan and Felix) having it as their
native language</dt>
<br>
<dt>- They were both the 3rd most streamed Korean Male Group and 4th most streamed Korean artist on the music application <i>Spotify</i> in 2021</dt>
