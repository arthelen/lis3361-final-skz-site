<center><h2><i>Set Up for Success Assignment (SU4S)</i></h2>
<p>While making my wepbage for this assignment, I found
it to be quite simple for the most part, while other aspects of it were a bit more challenging. For the
coding and creating the main website (along with this side one) I knew how to code it mostly and if I was
confused, I did some research and got it to work another way. As for what went wrong, when I intially
uploaded my webpage and checked it on my phone, the spacing was extremely off despite me putting everything in the center in my code.
Also, I wanted to add an icon next to the tab name, so it would not just be the default world logo or blank and
it took quite a bit of time and research to figure out, however I got it eventually and it worked!
For the spacing issue, I realized it was due to my images and their size, so I adjusted the proportions of the pictures accordingly
to make it look aesthetically pleasing. I say the challenges mostly lied in dealing with FileZilla. While I did
not experience any major issues, I am still very new to the program and uploading a website in general
whereas with coding HTML I have been exposed to it before. This brings me into what I knew coming in to
this assignment. I took an AP Computer Science course back in high school so I was already quite familiar
and knowledgable of how HTML works, especially with the basics like what we are working with now. Something new to
me though was the vast amount you can change a simple webpage by just adding little codes here and there. Since I only
knew basic HTML, looking up how to change certain things was incredibly intriguing to me and made this assignment that
much more enjoyable! That being said, through making this website I learned that I can do virtually almost anything with
a simple HTML website with easy (in my opinion) code compared to other types of coding and that HTML may just be my favorite
type of coding there is! For tips I would mostly list the little codes here and there that can make drastic changes
(in a good way) to HTML pages, such as color, font-family, color-background, padding, table elements, etc!
Additionally, I would give the advice of always putting in both the starting tag and ending tag at the same time!
This prevents from potential confusion or miscoding later on, as you may have not closed a center tag when you thought you did
for example (this actually happened to me when making the website, but I figured it out). One more thing to
reflect upon is my choice of topic for my website, Stray Kids, because it may be seen as an "interesting"
choice compared to what my peers probably did! I chose to do a music group, specifically Stray Kids, because I heavily
enjoy listening to music and they are my favorite artist. Furthermore, I felt I could really
work with the requirements for this assignment (having a table, an image, etc) with this kind of subject. Plus, since
they themselves and their music are things I enjoy, it made this assignment really enjoyable as a whole!

<center><h2><i>Project 1</i></h2>
<p>To start, this assignment was definitely more of a learning curve for me as I have not been exposed
to creating a side menu (using iFrames) like we had to here. As for what went right, creating the initial
resume (since I did not do that for the SU4S assignment), went practically without complications since it
was the typical HTML I was familiar with. Adding images, links, links within images, a table, list, and overall all
the aspects were not difficult to create. It was when I worked on the style sheets was when a few things went wrong!
I had more issue with the external style sheet than internal, because when I would link my other HTML pages to the
external css file, they were not taking on the styles I declared (colors, size, etc). I eventually discovered after
some research I had the layout for the css file wrong and I included a bunch of properties that were unnecesary.
Thinking about it now, the internal style sheet actual went without much complication, it was moreso of me debating
what I could group together to all have the same style traits (like do I want to make all headings the same color,
all paragraphs the same size, things like that). Creating that original resume since I had to for this project was
the easiest part of this assignment because again, I was already quite experienced in doing that. Learning about how
to work with external style sheets was hard. They are quite simple when you figure it all out, but initially, for
me personally, figuring out that basic layout was a bit difficult to find out (though I probably made it much harder
than I needed to in hindsight). A major issue I faced was the size of my website. When I had finished most of it, I
checked it on my phone after posting it online, and it was stuck in a square shape. Furthermore, I noticed it was
cut off a bit at the bottom on my computer when I viewed it, but I thought it was supposed to be like that and it was
not until I saw it on my phone that I realized it was an issue. I had just assumed this was a thing that would
happen when you create a menu bar, since I had not done one before and was not familiar with everything involved
in creating them, but alas, that was not the case! I was having difficulty figuring out what the root issue was, because
when I opened each HTML page separate from the menu, the size was fine, but when the menu was attached, it had a problem.
After some experimenting and looking back at the videos provided, I realized this was due to the "height" attribute in
my iFrame tags. It was set to "900" which, based on what I have learned, would mean the page will only fill up 900 pixels
in height. So, to fix this, I set the height to "100%" to fill the entire page, regardless of if it were to be displayed on
a computer or a phone, and the problem was solved! For this project I used the Notepad++ software as my editor and tested
it in Chrome on my computer and Safari on my phone. The first time I opened my page in a browser to test it, I had that
sizing issue of it being cut off. To describe it a bit more, I could view the whole page, but I would have to scroll down
and there was just a white space where it cut off. But again, I figured out the problem and was able to move past it.
One thing to add to this reflection, especially since style sheetes were so prominent for this project, I must admit it
was incredibly satisfying to take out most of my inline style changes when I added an external style sheet to the HTML documents!
It made my code look much more neat and cohesive, of course there was still some styling within, but all in all it was nice!
Overall, this was quite a challenging yet fun project to do, and as usual, I thoroughly enjoyed the style aspects of it
and being able to make my website fit the aesthetic I was going for!

<center><h2><i>Project 2</i></h2>
<p>For Project 1, I said it was quite the learning experience for me, however I would definitely say this assignment, Project 2,
had an even greater learning curve. For Project 1, it was mostly iFrames I needed to learn, so only one thing I was unaware of how to do, though this time
around for the requirements, I knew nothing, meaning I had to learn four new things (image maps, floating box, fixed header, and
three panel page). Regardless of the difficulties this entailed, it was incredibly fun for me as always (especially when things actually 
worked when I went to check them in my browser). This leads me into what went smoothly, basically right from the start. I would say out of the four main
requirements, the three panel page was what mostly went right. I got the three panels along with the corresponding text and pictures to show up properly
almost instantly. However, something did go a bit wrong at first regarding the middle panel, the one that is meant to be adjustable while the left
and right panels are meant to stay fixed. When I would go to resize the window, it shrunk the middle panel completely rather than stopping
where my table of pictures stopped (like how it stopped in the video tutorial for layouts posted on Canvas). Eventually I solved this by including the
body container and corresponding elements in my style sheet for the three columns. Though this was definitely not the only thing that
went sour during this assignment. For my fixed header, I would view the HTML page separately in another tab and the header would fill the
entire width of the page, but the content below it would not. Instead, it only filled up a bit more than half of the width of the
website window. I figured this issue lied in my body container elements in my style sheet that I mentioned earlier. After messing with the
max-width specifically, I figured it out and it fits (from what I can see, so hopefully it does for you too) well! I also had issues with
the floating box for this project as I created the box and tried to view it in multiple browsers after I posted the edited files to FileZilla. I
tried Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Safari, however it only showed in Chrome, while the others just showed regular text with no actual box around it.
I kept researching what may cause this issue until I realized potentially the most simple solution--clear my
cache in every browser. I did this and what do you know, the box showed up! I realized quite early on in this assignment that I would have to
delete my cache every so often to make sure everything was showing as it should. This was easy to do obviously, since it is just a simple setting
in the browser or within the device the site is being viewed on. I say this not trying to be intentionally negative, but this was probably one of the few
things in this assignment that was easy! Adding the link to my ePortfolio on my resume was quite simple since I am familiar with adding links thanks to our previous assignments.
Furthermore, using FileZilla to post my new sites and updates to my webspace was also easy since I
have become more and more comfortable using it since our very first site we had to post. Onto what was hard, I am a visual person, so the image map
and figuring out the exact coordinates for my two links was a little difficult since I could not actually see the clickable shapes on the image (if that
makes sense). Eventually I figured it out with a lot of trial and error and testing a variety of coordinates. Furthermore, I would say everything I mentioned already above
regarding the floating box and fixed header was a bit difficult to figure out, but once I got it, it all made sense! Once again I used the Notepad++
editor to complete this project, one that I think is quite simple and easy to use and navigate compared to other editors I have used.
In the past I only tested my website in Chrome and Safari, however this time around, like I said above, I
added another browser, Microsoft Edge (so overall I tested it in Chrome and Microsoft Edge on the computer and in Safari on the phone). I would like to add for clarification
the location of each requirement since some may be hard to find: the image maps are both on the USF archway image on my home page, the floating box is on my contact page,
and the fixed header along with the three panels are both on my new ePortfolio page you mentioned for us to create on Canvas. As a little bonus or fun fact, I made the link for one of my image maps my major's
information at the end of the archway's path to symbolize "finishing" or "ending" my college journey when I get that degree with that major! All in all, Project 2 was definitely
a step up from our previous assignments, especially in terms of difficulty, but that is what learning is about, and I am pretty confident in my abilities in creating
each of these elements now!

<center><h2><i>Project 3 (Final)</i></h2>
<p>Overall, I would definitely say this final project is potentially the one that took me the longest. I understand we only had to add the contact form for this project, but,
because we were given complete free range on the topic, I decided to take advantage of that and basically created a whole new website. I used previous HTML pages I had made in
this class to help speed up the process a bit, however I definitely spent my time on this one! As for what went right, I would say most of the requirements that were required
in prevous assignments (because they all have to be included in this final) all went smoothly. For instance, the music releases table, the target links on the members page,
the style sheets, inluding links as texts or images, and so on. As for what went wrong...quite a few things to say the least. The biggest and most prominent for this aassignment
specifically being the contact form. I had watched all the JavaScript videos and understood what the code meant and such and typed out the code myself. The text boxes to type the
information (name, email, etc) came up along with the buttons, but when I clicked the "Send message!" button it would not print out the text in the "Message sent:" box. I triple
checked all of the spelling on my functions and variables and made sure all my tags were closed to see if that was causing the issue. Even after doing that, I was still stuck
with this problem. I then referred to the code samples you provided in our modules and was comparing mine to that and boom--I had discovered the issue! I was using semicolons instead
of colons after each case in the function section in my head tag! I think I was so used to putting semicolons after everything in my programming class using JAVA that I did not
look that closely at the code in the video you provided as I figured it would just be semicolons, but alas, I learned my lesson there! There were definitely a few challenges after
fixing this issue though. I wanted my contact form and the text boxes to be in the middle of the page rather than to the left, but simple center tags were not working for me. I ended
up putting "align="center"" in my table tag under the form tag, which worked, but then it considered both the text and text boxes to be centered together if that makes sense? Which
then made it look like the text boxes were not centered and were instead too far to the right. I kept trying a bunch of centers and aligns here and there, and then eventually I reverted to one of
the attributes I have come to love through this course--padding! I added some padding to the right within the table tag after the align attribute and adjusted it according to what I
figured looked appealing. I knew quite a bit going into this final assignment as our previous projects leading up to this taught me a lot! I knew of course about what I consider to be the
basics, things like headings, bold, italic, font size, font family, links, images, etc. On the other hand, what was new to me I think was only how to do the contact form, especially
because that used JavaScript, which I am not all that familiar with. Elaborating on that thought, the concept of JavaScript was also new to me, and I found it really surprising yet
interesting that using JavaScript within HTML could be as simple as adding script tags and the associated JavaScript code, and that was it! Of course I understand this is a
sort of beginner course to HTML and JavaScript so it probably gets more complex, but I would have imagined putting JavaScript in at all would be a lot more difficult. Therefore, the contact
form (aside from the printing issues) and overall JavaScript part of this project was easier than I thought it would be. What was harder than I thought it would be, however, was just how
much time starting essentially from scratch would take. I did not realize how many pages I ended up with until I met all the requirements, but wow, it was quite a lot, which of course meant
spending more time than I may have previously because there are more pages to code and debug. Through Project 3
I learned about myself that I really, really am big on color schemes and making sure everything on my pages matches and flows well. I spent more time than I would like to admit solely
on choosing pictures and further editing the colors, brightness, contrast, and so on of those pictures so they would match well. Tips for the future this time around I will say is to
start such a big project (because I somewhat started from scratch) earlier. Not to expose myself, but I feel I did this a bit more last minute than I should have, so I definitely will
take into account for future assignments to start even earlier than I think I need to. It was fun to play around with different aspects of HTML I came across while making all of these
pages for this project. I messed around quite a bit with colors, images, lists, placement of different things, and so on. It was cool to see how different a page would look if I changed something as
simple as moving an image from the top of the document to the bottom. I guess in that case, I disliked obviously when something went wrong or did not work, and then I would have to read
through my entire code, checking for mispellings and missing end tags, because while some of my HTML pages were short, others had seemingly endless amounts of tags to look through! Speaking of
tags, it is important to add alt tags to images because if the image does not load for whatever reason (mispelled file name, wrong file type, image not being in a folder, etc)
whoever was accessing the page can see what it was supposed to be of. Rather than just forever wondering what the image was supposed to be, it lets them know what was meant to show up.
Plus, it looks nicer to add a bit of descriptive text next
to that missing image picture the browser gives. I feel like this may be a trick question but...Section 508 "is an important amendment to The Rehabilitation Act that protects the right
of people with disabilities to have equal access to electronic and information technology" according to https://www.essentialaccessibility.com/blog/section-508-compliance-testing-checklist.
Yes, my URL works and does indeed start with http:// (http://arthelen.myweb.usf.edu/)! The difference between http:// and file:// is that with http, it is a path to a link on the USF web space,
where anyone can access it. With file, it is pointing to a path on someone's computer, meaning that it is not actually on the Internet for pretty much anyone to access, and therefore means
you, the teacher, are not able to access it as well and grade it--which is kind of a pickle! For all of the styles I chose, yep, they all do work luckily! Other things that would be important to reflect on would definitely be that I discovered how to embed Spotify (a music application) playlists onto a webpage! I got way more excited about
this than I would like to admit, especially because I used Spotify myself a lot and listen to music quite a bit, but seriously it was fascinating being able to add a playlist
that the user can just play in the background as they scroll through my site. I did not end up leaving it in this site as it did not flow well in my opinion with my layout (because like I
said, I learned that I am truly a stickler for having my pages look nice). However, since I found it so cool, I definitely think it is worth sharing and reflecting upon for this project. While on the
subject of music, I would like to quickly address my choice of the topic of my website here. I mentioned in a previous assignment, since I also did it on the music group Stray Kids, but just to reiterate,
I did it on this group because I thoroughly enjoy music and they are my favorite group! Both personality-wise and with the music they create, I find them really interesting and figured I could meet
many of the requirements for this website if I did it on such a topic!
One more thing I would like to add, being this is our final project and this course is coming to a close, I had a ton of fun this semester and this was definitely one of my favorite classes!
Thank you for a great few months and allowing for me to learn so, so much! Take care! :)
