<h2><i>Background</i></h2>
<p style="font-size:1.5em"><b><i>Stray Kids</i></b>, also referred to as <i>SKZ</i>, is an 8 member K-Pop group
from South Korea. They were formed through a show<br> of the same name, Stray Kids, back in late 2017.
They officially debuted on March 25, 2018, with an album titled "I am NOT" <br>and have since had multiple
releases. Their songs are mostly self-produced by 3 of their members (referred to as <i>3RACHA</i>):<br>
Bang Chan, Changbin, and Han, who were together before Stray Kids were formed. <a href="https://kprofiles.com/3racha-members-profile/" target="_blank">3RACHA</a> alone have released 3
mixtapes <br>and over 25 songs. Stray Kids as a whole currently have over 125 songs, however this is not including
their "unofficial" songs,<br> which increases that number quite a bit. They have released over 50 music videos
along with a variety of other content, including things<br> such as <i>SKZ-TALKER, SKZ-PLAYER, SKZ-RECORD</i>, dance practices, and more.
This is only a small amount of what encompasses<br> Stray Kids, so for more information/to look more into them,
<a href="https://straykids.jype.com/" target="_blank">here</a> is a link to their website (or you can click on the image of them above)!<p>
